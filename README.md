# StatsC

StatsC lets you log statistics to your graphite/statsd servers straight from the browser.

Just like StatsD, StatsC is a fire and forget thing. StatsC can't take your site down if it fails, only statistics won't get logged.

StatsC is __transport agnostic__ so you can use whatever transport method you want.

By default it uses script-tags to provide cross domain ajax without using any libraries. Logging operations are buffered for 5s and then transmitted together.

## Installation

### Server

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g statsc
$ statsc-server
  StatsC server listening on port 8127
```

or

```bash
$ npm install statsc
```

```javascript
var statsc = require('statsc');
var http = require('http');

http.createServer(statsc.http).listen(8127, function() {
  console.log('StatsC server listening on port 8127');
});
```

### Client

Include the client script in your `<head>`:

```html
<script src="client.js"></script>
```

For testing you can serve it from rawgithub.com:

```html
<script src="https://rawgithub.com/godmodelabs/statsc/master/client.js"></script>
```

StatsC automatically sends collected metrics to `http://localhost:8127/` over the standard transport.

You can scale this thing up easily by just picking one of your available servers randomly, like:

```javascript
var availablePorts = [8127, 8128, 8129];
var port = availablePorts[Math.round(Math.random()*availablePorts.length)-1];
stats.connect('addr:'+port);
```

## Server API

### statsc.http(req, res)
HTTP(s) server handle. Pass to http(s).createServer() in order to handle the standard script-tag transport.

### statsc.receive(op)
Logs `op` to StatsD.

You have to use this if you don't use `statsc.http`.

Example with Learnboost/socket.io:

```javascript
socket.on('statsc', function(data) {
 statsc.receive(data);
});
```

### statsc.setAddress(addr)
Configure the address at which StatsD runs.

## Client API

### statsc.connect(addr)
Use this if the server isnt listening on `http://localhost:8127` or perhaps if you are using a custom `send` method.

### statsc.increment(stat[, sampleRate])
Increment the counter at `stat` by 1.

### statsc.decrement(stat[, sampleRate])
Decrement the counter at `stat` by 1.

### statsc.gauge(stat, value[, sampleRate])
Set the gauge at `stat` to `value`.

### statsc.timing(stat, time[, sampleRate])
Log `time` to `stat`.

`time` can either be

  * a number in milliseconds
  * a Date object, created at the timer's start
  * a synchronous function to be timed

### statsc.timer(stat[, sampleRate])
Timer utility in functional style.

Returns a function you can call when you want to mark your timer as resolved.

### statsc.send(data)
Standard implementation of a `send` method using script tags. This shouldn't need to be called manually.

Overwrite this if you want to use websockets or jsonp or whatever.

Example using LearnBoost/socket.io:

```javascript
statsc.send = function(data) {
 socket.emit('statsc', data);
};
```
